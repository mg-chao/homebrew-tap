  caveats <<~EOS
    Snow Shot reuses a signing identity in your login Keychain. The first install
    may request Keychain access. Grant Screen Recording and Accessibility when
    macOS requests them. Local signing does not provide Apple notarization.
    Keep ~/Library/Application Support/Snow Shot/Installer and its Keychain
    identity across upgrades and reinstalls. Use the same installing account.
